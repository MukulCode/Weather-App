# Weather-App
Weather app uses Weather API and provides the weather of that location. 
The UI of this app is pretty attractive and the Weather API works perfectly with the UI.
User can get those information including Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, Weather status by using weather Api. 
I have used Java programming language.
